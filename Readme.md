Special Thanks
--------------

Special thanks to Bruce Lindbloom not only for his color formulas
but for his color converter as well, both of which played a major
role in this module.

You can find his site here:

Other than Bruce, many people and projects inspired alchemist as a whole. They
are listed here:

- [chroma.js](https://github.com/gka/chroma.js)
- [color-convert](https://github.com/harthur/color-convert)
- [colormine](https://github.com/colormine/colormine)
- [d3.js](https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Colors)
- and many more...

Thanks to all of you!
